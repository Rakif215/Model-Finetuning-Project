# Model Finetuning Project

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning pre-trained models using Hugging Face's `Transformers` library and the `TRL` (Transformers Reinforcement Learning) library. The goal of this project is to provide a modular, reproducible process for customizing models for specific tasks, such as text classification or other NLP tasks.

## Project Overview

The key components of this project are:
- **Training a pre-trained model** on custom datasets using transfer learning.
- **Deploying the fine-tuned model** for real-world inference tasks.
- **Script-based execution**, making it easily adaptable to various NLP tasks.

This project is ideal for NLP enthusiasts, data scientists, and engineers looking to extend pre-trained models for specialized tasks with minimal code changes.

## Project Structure

- **finetuning.py**: Main script to train and fine-tune a pre-trained model.
- **install_packages.py**: Script to install all the required dependencies.
- **requirements.txt**: List of all dependencies required for running the project.
- **use_finetuned_model.py**: Script for loading and using the fine-tuned model for predictions.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by either using the provided install script or `requirements.txt`.

### Use the Install Script
